# SMART-PEDESTRIAN-CROSSING-SYSTEM
This project involves the use of IR sensors and a real-time monitoring system to detect pedestrians and control traffic signals. As the signal changes, pop-up barricades are activated to manage the movement of vehicles and pedestrians, making crossings safer and improving traffic flow.
# AIM
To enhance pedestrian safety, improve traffic efficiency, and create a more visible and responsive crosswalk system through real-time monitoring and smart control technologies.
